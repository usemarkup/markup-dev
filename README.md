Installer for the Markup Laptops (mostly aimed at running VMs)

### Installs

- Brew (for Ruby/PHP etc)
- Ruby >= 2.4
- PHP 7.1
- Bundler (To install gems)
- Vagrant (to aid running virtual machines)

Will check and instruct you on what to do to get VirtualBox installed but will not actually do it due to some restrictions in what Brew can do.

### How to use

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usemarkup/markup-dev/master/init.sh | bash
```
